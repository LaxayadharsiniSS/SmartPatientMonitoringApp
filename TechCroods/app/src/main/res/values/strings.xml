    <string name="aboutContent">Smart Patient Monitoring System developed by TechCroods is a wireless health monitoring system (WHMS) mainly for facilitating better communication between patient and the doctor and intended for the usage in intensive care units (ICUs). We believe that this system will transform health care delivery and management. If you are involved in running a hospital or if you are a care provider, a working person, a senior citizen or a patient at ICU, this system will be useful for easy communication between the patient and the Doctor/Attender/Nurse wherein the patient would feel protected in ICU.
